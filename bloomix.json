		"description": "# ðŸš€ Get started here\n\nThis template guides you through CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), variables, and tests.\n\n## ðŸ”– **How to use this template**\n\n#### **Step 1: Send requests**\n\nRESTful APIs allow you to perform CRUD operations using the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.\n\nThis collection contains each of these [request](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/) types. Open each request and click \"Send\" to see what happens.\n\n#### **Step 2: View responses**\n\nObserve the response tab for status code (200 OK), response time, and size.\n\n#### **Step 3: Send new Body data**\n\nUpdate or add new data in \"Body\" in the POST request. Typically, Body data is also used in PUT request.\n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"Add your name in the body\"\n}\n\n ```\n\n#### **Step 4: Update the variable**\n\nVariables enable you to store and reuse values in Postman. We have created a [variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) called `base_url` with the sample request [https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me](https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me). Replace it with your API endpoint to customize this collection.\n\n#### **Step 5: Add tests in the \"Tests\" tab**\n\nTests help you confirm that your API is working as expected. You can write test scripts in JavaScript and view the output in the \"Test Results\" tab.\n\n<img src=\"https://content.pstmn.io/b5f280a7-4b09-48ec-857f-0a7ed99d7ef8/U2NyZWVuc2hvdCAyMDIzLTAzLTI3IGF0IDkuNDcuMjggUE0ucG5n\">\n\n## ðŸ’ª Pro tips\n\n- Use folders to group related requests and organize the collection.\n- Add more [scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/) in \"Tests\" to verify if the API works as expected and execute workflows.\n    \n\n## ðŸ’¡Related templates\n\n[API testing basics](https://go.postman.co/redirect/workspace?type=personal&collectionTemplateId=e9a37a28-055b-49cd-8c7e-97494a21eb54&sourceTemplateId=ddb19591-3097-41cf-82af-c84273e56719)  \n[API documentation](https://go.postman.co/redirect/workspace?type=personal&collectionTemplateId=e9c28f47-1253-44af-a2f3-20dce4da1f18&sourceTemplateId=ddb19591-3097-41cf-82af-c84273e56719)  \n[Authorization methods](https://go.postman.co/redirect/workspace?type=personal&collectionTemplateId=31a9a6ed-4cdf-4ced-984c-d12c9aec1c27&sourceTemplateId=ddb19591-3097-41cf-82af-c84273e56719)",
